The News App is an Android application that provides users with the latest news articles from various sources. It utilizes the News API to fetch news data in JSON format and displays the news articles in a user-friendly interface. Users can read article titles, descriptions, and view accompanying images. The app uses the Volley library for network requests, RecyclerView for displaying news articles, and Glide library for image loading. Additionally, users can click on an article to open the corresponding news site within the app using in-app webpages.
